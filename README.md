Android Accessory in Python

## Installation and setup

To install the Android application, have a look at the [latest release][releases] and download the APK from your smartphone.

For the client, clone this repository to your local environment. The main dependancies is ``PyUSB``, which is a project now [hosted on GitHub][pysub]. I am used to install it with ``sudo pip install pyusb`` on a Linux box.

## Quick start

````
$ sudo python client/pyaccessory.py
````
